##Mapping
1. instead of using GPS or SLAM, we can place four anchor points to form the mapping system. 
* P1(0, 0, 0), P2(x, 0, 0), P3(0, y, 0,), P4(0, 0, Z)
* notes: arcore cannot measure height now
* yet we found that different plans are colored differently, so potentially, we could detect different planes and also detect the wall by
calculating the plane perpendicularly.
